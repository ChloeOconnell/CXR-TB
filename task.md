# Background

When patients with HIV present to clinic or the hospital with pulmonary symptoms (i.e. cough, shortness of breath) in the developing world, diagnostic workup often starts with a chest x-ray (CXR). The current diagnostic algorithm first determines whether infiltrates are unilateral vs. bilateral, and then goes on to include a variety of additional diagnostic tests (i.e. blood cultures, sputum cultures, urine PCR, etc.). Although CXRs are easy to obtain, there is currently a shortage of radiologists to interpret these studies, and this creates a bottleneck for treatment. In the case of tuberculosis or pneumonia, delays in treatment (particularly in patients with HIV) can be devastating, particularly because for patients with limited access to care, a follow-up visit when a radiologist is available may not be logistically feasible. 

The main diseases we are trying to evaluate for are pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly PCP), tuberculosis (TB), or “other pulmonary process/pneumonia”. PJP is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV, and affects up to 22.4% of inpatients with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (1). Although it is not generally fatal in immunocompetent patients, its mortality rate in patients with HIV is approximately 19% (Wasserman et al., 2012). The current gold standard for diagnosis is bronchoscopy, which can be difficult in developing countries because it requires a specific procedure and PCR testing, which are not only costly but can require sophisticated medical equipment and additional personnel to complete. Although CXR can assist with diagnosis, this modality is not considered a substitute for more resource-intensive testing (Lowe et al., 2013). Clinical prediction rules involving symptomatology, lab values, and CXR findings have been explored, with AUCs between 0.76 and 0.80 (Maartens et al; unpublished manuscript), but these still require radiologist interpretation of a chest radiograph. 

Like PJP, tuberculosis is particularly devastating in patients with HIV, and is thought to be the leading cause of HIV-related deaths globally (Gupta et al., 2015). It is not only thought to be the cause of death in 37% of AIDS deaths worldwide, but remains undiagnosed in approximately 45.8% of cases (Gupta et al., 2015). Definitive diagnosis relies on sputum or pleural fluid cultures, but these can often produce false negatives that lead to delays in diagnosis, producing potentially harmful delays in treatment. Given the difficulties of diagnosing TB using sputum cultures in resource-poor settings, a variety of clinical prediction tools and alternative diagnostic tests have been explored. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test for simultaneous rapid tuberculosis diagnosis and rapid antibiotic sensitivity test designed to facilitate diagnosis of TB in the developing world. Its reported sensitivity and specificity are approximately 86% and 96%, respectively. Given that this test is not available everywhere, an alternative clinical prediction rule (which included interpretation of CXR by a radiologist) has been developed that was able to diagnose TB with an accuracy of 81% (sensitivity of 78-87%, sensitivity of 59-58%, depending on decision threshold) (Grisel et al., accepted for publication). The ability to diagnose tuberculosis based on CXR alone, particularly without the need for a radiologist, could potentially reduce both barriers to diagnosis and time to treatment for infected patients, which could ultimately save lives. 

The clinical utility of our project hinges on the exact problem we chose to solve. Currently, we are exploring the following possibilities: 
1.	Identifying cavitation and lymphadenopathy on CXR (these are helpful if not necessary for the diagnosis of tuberculosis)
2.	Identifying unilateral lobar vs. bilateral, multiple, or diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (this is helpful if not necessary for the diagnosis of PJP)
3.	Identifying radiological pneumonia vs. radiological PJP vs. radiological TB
4.	Identifying “gold standard / ground truth” pneumonia vs. PJP vs. TB (in the case of pneumonia, “gold standard” could mean either cough + radiological evidence OR it could mean radiological evidence + improvement with antibiotics – it depends on what data we can get)
